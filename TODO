New Widgets

   * add tree support
   * add popup support
   * support more than one window

Widget Features

   * support multiple selection
   * color picker will not fire events if type is set to button
   * support sorting and filtering on client
   * support lazy loading and server-side models for text, tabs, decks,
     list/tree data, RDF templates?
   * support mixed content (Hello <b>world</b>)
   * create widgets using XUL XML instead of XUL Perl API, with template
     support
   * support easy creation of new Perl widget classes, with no XBL
   * support client-side only events, 
   * use Coro continuations for modal dialog boxes
   * add proper listenable support to node, instead of callback setting
   * support calling XUL methods with more than one param
   * only send modification to client if attribute has actually changed

Server Features

   * add session kill method for user code
   * add package reload to server, Apache::Reload style
   * add another HTTP connection, for server initiated messages
   * add something like Apache2 perl-script handler, so you don't have to
     implement start()
   * better cleanup required after user code exceptions
   * performance: stop flushing all nodes for each event
	* test performance
   * clean up weak nodes from event manager when destroyed
   * figure out some way to throw away, on server side, widgets that
     never change or recieve events, so we can free memory
   * allow some async events
   * support event bundling
   * add compression
   * look into message store caching

Testing

   * improve unit tests
   * create acceptance tests by automating Firefox
   * assert only one event is sent over the wire per high-level event

Refactorings

   * refactor support code out of node: attribute handling, compositing,
     events, use aspects
   * probably change Click event in Perl to Command
   * refactor session timer out of server using aspects
   * replace conditionals in Runner.js and Application.js with polymorphism
     using node prototypes
   * auto convert XBL files to some schema so we can check method calls on
     server

Other

   * create real demo applications
   * construct a high-level MVC framework on top of our low-level widgets
