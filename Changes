Revision history for XUL-Node

0.06 Sat Mar 24 2007

    * you can no longer create nodes using $node->Label syntax- this will
      BREAK all code using this syntax. Change it to:
      $node->add_child(Label). Cannot support both methods, so one had
      to go
    * updated to support Firefox 2.0
    * moved all javascript to mootools style classes
      (http://dev.mootools.net/wiki/gettingStarted)
    * started using JSAN for remote javascript classloading
      (http://www.openjsan.org/doc/c/cw/cwest/JSAN/0.10/index.html)
    * started using FireBug for javascript unit tests, which will not
      run without it
      (http://www.getfirebug.com/)
    * fixed spelling error with ToolBarSeperator tag name (thanks to
	  Rutger Vos)
    * subclassing XUL::Node- create your own Perl XUL widgets, from base
      XUL elements. See CustomWidgetsExample, CustomNodeTest,
      CustomCompositeNodeTest, and and the custom_composite_widget_state
      test method in the ChangeManager tests. Undocumented yet.
    * started MVC work- see MVCTextBoxExample, MultipleViewsExample, and
      Model::Value/MVC unit tests. Undocumented yet. API WILL change.
    * node uses Aspect::Library::Listenable for event handling, so you
      can add more than one listener to a node- used to be you could only
      add one
    * added get_parent_node to XUL::Node, using weak refs to avoid cycles-
      now you can navigate from a node to any other node in the window
    * fixed bug in Runner.js- value attribute should be set as late as
      possible. You can now set the value in a TextBox, even after someone
      changed its value by typing inside it. Hack to get around a known
      mozilla bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108482)
    * added check in ChangeManager- dont pass to client any changes to the
      XUL document that are already at the client
    * refactoring: cleaned up exporting logic in XUL::Node
    * refactoring: arranged classes more sensibly, instead of having them
      all squatting in the same dir
    * use latest Aspect module
    * documentation errors fixed
